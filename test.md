# Migraine Prediction ML Project - Implementation Steps

## Phase 1: Data Preparation & Exploration

### Step 1: Data Loading and Initial Exploration
```python
# Key tasks:
- Load the generated dataset
- Check data types, missing values, and basic statistics
- Visualize data distributions
- Examine class imbalance (migraine vs non-migraine days)
```

**Deliverables:**
- Data quality report
- Distribution plots for all features
- Correlation heatmap
- Class imbalance analysis

### Step 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
```python
# Analysis focus areas:
- Migraine occurrence patterns by day of week/month
- Feature relationships with migraine occurrence
- User-specific patterns and variations
- Temporal patterns and seasonality
- Feature interactions (sleep + stress, screen time + hydration)
```

**Deliverables:**
- EDA notebook with insights
- Feature importance ranking
- Pattern identification document

### Step 3: Feature Engineering
```python
# Create new features:
- Rolling averages (3-day, 7-day sleep/stress averages)
- Consecutive poor sleep days counter
- Sleep debt calculation
- Stress-sleep interaction terms
- Day of week encoding
- Weekend/weekday binary feature
- Previous day migraine flag
- Hydration-screen time interaction
```

**Deliverables:**
- Feature engineering pipeline
- New feature correlation analysis
- Feature selection rationale

## Phase 2: Data Preprocessing

### Step 4: Data Cleaning and Validation
```python
# Tasks:
- Handle any outliers or anomalies
- Validate data consistency across users
- Check for temporal data leakage
- Split data by users (not randomly) to avoid data leakage
```

### Step 5: Train-Test Split Strategy
```python
# Important considerations:
- User-based splitting (not random) to test generalization
- Temporal splitting (earlier dates for training)
- Stratified sampling to maintain class balance
- Consider 70-15-15 split (train-validation-test)
```

**Split Options:**
- **Option A:** User-based (6 users train, 1 validation, 1 test)
- **Option B:** Temporal (first 70% of dates for each user)
- **Option C:** Hybrid approach

## Phase 3: Model Development

### Step 6: Baseline Models
```python
# Start with simple models:
1. Logistic Regression
2. Decision Tree
3. Random Forest
4. Naive Bayes
```

**Evaluation Metrics:**
- Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score
- ROC-AUC, PR-AUC
- Confusion Matrix
- **Focus on Recall** (catching migraines is more important than false alarms)

### Step 7: Advanced Models
```python
# Try more sophisticated approaches:
1. Gradient Boosting (XGBoost, LightGBM)
2. Support Vector Machine
3. Neural Networks (for temporal patterns)
4. Ensemble methods
```

### Step 8: Time Series Approaches (Optional)
```python
# If treating as time series:
1. LSTM/GRU networks
2. Time series features with traditional ML
3. Prophet for trend analysis
```

## Phase 4: Model Optimization

### Step 9: Hyperparameter Tuning
```python
# Use techniques:
- Grid Search CV
- Random Search CV
- Bayesian Optimization (Optuna)
- Cross-validation strategy respecting temporal/user splits
```

### Step 10: Feature Selection
```python
# Methods to try:
- Recursive Feature Elimination
- Feature importance from tree models
- L1 regularization (Lasso)
- Statistical tests (chi-square, ANOVA)
```

### Step 11: Handle Class Imbalance
```python
# Techniques:
- SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling)
- Class weights adjustment
- Threshold tuning
- Cost-sensitive learning
```

## Phase 5: Model Evaluation & Validation

### Step 12: Comprehensive Evaluation
```python
# Evaluation framework:
- Cross-validation with proper splits
- Learning curves
- Feature importance analysis
- Model interpretability (SHAP values)
- Error analysis on misclassified cases
```

### Step 13: Model Interpretability
```python
# Tools to use:
- SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations)
- LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations)
- Feature importance plots
- Partial dependence plots
```

### Step 14: Validation on Unseen Data
```python
# Final validation:
- Test on completely unseen users
- Temporal validation (future dates)
- A/B testing framework design
```

## Phase 6: Advanced Analysis

### Step 15: Severity Prediction (Multi-class)
```python
# Extend to predict migraine severity (0, 1, 2, 3):
- Multi-class classification models
- Ordinal regression approaches
- Separate binary classifiers
```

### Step 16: Personalization Analysis
```python
# User-specific insights:
- Individual model performance
- Personal trigger identification
- Customized threshold setting
- User clustering based on patterns
```

### Step 17: Temporal Pattern Analysis
```python
# Advanced time series analysis:
- Seasonal decomposition
- Trend analysis
- Cyclical pattern detection
- Lead time analysis (how early can we predict?)
```

## Phase 7: Production Considerations

### Step 18: Model Deployment Preparation
```python
# Prepare for deployment:
- Model serialization (pickle/joblib)
- API development (Flask/FastAPI)
- Input validation and preprocessing pipeline
- Real-time prediction capability
```

### Step 19: Monitoring and Maintenance
```python
# Set up monitoring:
- Model performance tracking
- Data drift detection
- Retraining pipeline
- A/B testing framework
```

## Phase 8: Business Application

### Step 20: Risk Scoring System
```python
# Create practical applications:
- Daily risk score (0-100)
- Early warning system
- Personalized recommendations
- Intervention suggestions
```

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

1. **Data Leakage:** Using future information to predict past events
2. **Random Splitting:** Not respecting user/temporal structure
3. **Overfitting:** Too complex models on small dataset
4. **Ignoring Imbalance:** Focusing only on accuracy
5. **Feature Selection Bias:** Using test data for feature selection
6. **Temporal Assumptions:** Assuming stationarity in patterns
